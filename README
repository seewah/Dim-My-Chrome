== Bugs, Issues & Feature Requests

This extension can dim pages on virtually all websites. However, two sites where page dimming does not work are Google Mail http://mail.google.com, and Google Chrome Extensions https://chrome.google.com/extensions due to some obscure Javascript on those pages, which I have yet to figure out. Do let me know if you have come across other sites that refuse to be dimmed out!
